I was born on August 15, 1998, and from an early age, I have felt a deep fascination for technology. My professional journey took a significant turn when I had the opportunity to intern at Cantv. During this time, I underwent programming courses that sparked my curiosity and inspired me to explore these technologies more deeply. It was then that I decided to continue my education, opting to study Systems Engineering.

My true love for programming is evident in my constant pursuit of challenges and my desire to participate in meaningful projects. I consider myself a lifelong learner and am committed to innovation, which drives me to stay updated with technological evolution and to contribute significantly in any work environment that promotes personal and professional growth and development.

I am excited for what the future holds and for the opportunities that may arise in the world of technology!
